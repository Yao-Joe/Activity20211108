eg5 introduce valgrind tool
After compiling and excuting the code, the result "HI!" is printed successfully.
While, use "valgrind ./test" command, you can see
"Invalid write of size 1"
"Invalid read of size 1"
Which means write and read 1 more invalid size
And if you change to malloc(4);
"All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible" is shown.
