Header:
Part1: 14 bytes long BITMAPFILEHEADER
Part2: 40 bytes long BITMAPINFOHEADER

bitmap:
An array of bytes, triples of which represents a pixel's color (stored in BGR)

An good example is to convert 1-bit smilery (black&white) to 24-bit smiley (colorful)

Goal: image filtering
Image filtering: imagine modification of pixels

An common filer:
Grayscale: Convert colorful image to black&white image.

How to filter?
As longs as values of red, green, blue are the same. The larger the same values, the brighter the pixels.
What if values of RGB is not the same, a simple way is taking average of pixel.

Another filer:
Sepia: Convert colorful image to sepia image, with an old-timey feel.

How to filter?
  sepiaRed = .393 * originalRed + .769 * originalGreen + .189 * originalBlue
  sepiaGreen = .349 * originalRed + .686 * originalGreen + .168 * originalBlue
  sepiaBlue = .272 * originalRed + .534 * originalGreen + .131 * originalBlue
And we need round the result. And make sure the values are capped at 255 at most.

Another filter:
Reflection: Look like an image in a mirror. 

How to filter?
Move left pixels to right.

Another filter:
Blur: Make image less clear.

How to filter?
Take average value of a grid of pixels. Like 3*3 grid.
