Notes here!!!

SQLite features (relational database):
1. use binary files that are more compact, efficient (others might be ASCII or)
2. tables (others might be sheets)

Approches:
1. (easier) .mode csv
            .import FILE TABLE
            .save 
Basics:            
SELECT title FROM shows WHERE title = "The Office";
SELECT title FROM shows WHERE title LIKE "%Office%";
SELECT DINSTINCT(UPPER(title)) FROM shows ORDER BY UPPER(title);
SELECT UPPER(title), COUNT(TRIM(title)) FROM shows GROUP BY UPPER(TRIM(title)) ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC LIMIT 10;

No csv type data, because 因为如果有符号，很难选%Music%，如果还有"Musical"，"Music",
INSERT INTO shows (Timestamp, title, genres) VALUES("now", "The Muppet Show", "Comedy, Musical");
UPDATE shows SET genres = "Comedy, Drama, Musical" WHERE title = "The Muppet Show";

Data type:
BLOB INTEGER NUMERIC REAL TEXT
Key word:
NOT NULL, UNIQUE

为了解决多个值用符号分割的问题，用foreign key和另一个table用行存储
