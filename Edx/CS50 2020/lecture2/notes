Notes here !!!

1. What happened after typing "make hello"? 
  clang -ggdb3 -O0 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wshadow    hello.c  -lcrypt -lcs50 -lm -o hello
Let's explain this!

"make" is a command line that helps to compile the .c file and create hello* file (0s and 1s, * means excutatble). So programer need not type "clang ....".
By the way, "clang -o hello" means compile and output machine code file named hello. "-o" is an option like other options "-lcs50", "-lm". 

Even thought we call the procedure compiling. Actually, in total, 4 steps are included in the compiling procedure:
  preprocessing: prepare full source code. eg, # include <stdio.h> : it can include standard i/o head file to source code
  compiling: convert source code to assembling code(汇编代码）
  assembling: convert assembling code to 0 and 1
  linking: linking all 0s and 1s together (0s and 1s are in different files, eg, .h, .c file) so that cpu runs 
But simply speaking, we just call them compiling.

2. Helpful tools:
  help50, style50, check50, printf, debug50, ddb(论坛)
Three things need to be emphasized. First, "printf" is used commonly, no matter how sophisticated programmers are. Second, ddb is a good way and do not be shy to ask questions.
Last, sincerely, debug50 is the most important tool. Set breakpoint and run debug50 ./<filename> and press <enter> in terminal window.

3. Size of data type:
  bool    1 Byte
  char    1 Byte
  double  8 Bytes
  float   4 Bytes
  int     4 Bytes
  long    8 Bytes
  
4. Always try to make code cleaner!!!

5. ALways try to make code more readable!!!
