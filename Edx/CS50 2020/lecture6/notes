Notes here!!!

1. data type: (so called loose type)
  bool float int str

2. data structure:
  range
  list: an automatic sized array
  tupleï¼šcoordinates (x,y)
  dict: like hash table, very fast, O is nearly constant number. 
  set: unique variable
 
3. "." in C is only getting into function and use variable, but in Python, also object's function

4. According to an example(not shown here) that C runs nearly twice faster than Python and why?
Python is an interpreted language and an interpreter. 
C will compile before run which is converting source code into machine code. Then run time is short.
But Python is like a program running all the time, when executing the "Python ./[filename]" command line, python will interpret the code one by one to machine code and execute.
And Python uses modules or other functions to support, then between source code and machine code lies other functions which may increase running time.
Just imagine to translate Japanese to English line by line.

5. *This lecture really shows a lot of fancy features of Python. Using Python, we can ignore low level design such as memory allocation, stable size array, declare variable, print format so on and so forth.
More importantly, Python provides many fancy modules for us to conveniently invoke and create interesting program in easy ways such as making QR code, image processing, face recognition, voice inpout and output.
This course is really interesting and arises interest of beginners and motivate beginners.
