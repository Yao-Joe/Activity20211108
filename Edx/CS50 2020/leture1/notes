Notes here!

1.
                ----------
 source code -> | compiler | -> machine code
                ----------
After compiling source code (hello.c), then excutable file (hello) which is bianry is generated. 

2.
              ----------
arguments -> | compiler | -> return values, variables
              ----------
data type: int, float, long, char, string, bool ...

3. variable statement is only effective in the scope, see eg1 wrong case

4. catagorize knowledge and connect knowledge by analogy

5. Given Mario bros as an example: 
use basic "for" loop can print four ? in a row or 3*3 brick 
Most similar cases in fancy games today use the same logic (good way to stimulate interest)

6. importance to understand limitation of computers, see eg2 :
  32 bits/ 64 bits can only represnt limited numbers
  precision is limited (take 1/10 as an example, the result is 0.1000000014901161193847656250000)
  
7. on 19 January 2038, we will experience the same problem on 1st January 2020 (Year 2000 bug)
Because 32 bits only represent 4 billion seconds from 1st January 1970
