// First C program, at ide.cs50.io (ide: integrated developemnt environment)

# include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, world");
}

/*
A-ha moment:
1.
                ----------
 source code -> | compiler | -> machine code
                ----------
After compiling source code (hello.c), then excutable file (hello) which is bianry is generated. 

2.
              ----------
arguments -> | compiler | -> return values, variables
              ----------
data type: int, float, long, char, string, bool ...

3. variable statement is only effective in the scope, eg wrong case
# include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    {
    int n = 1;  // if declare n in this scope {}, it is not effective outside of {}
    }
    n = 2;
    printf("%i", n);
}

Then lets correct it:
# include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 2;
    {
    n = 1;
    }
    printf("%i", n);
}
Then in ide terminal, input "make test" and "./test"

4. catagorize knowledge and connect knowledge by analogy

5. Given Mario bros as an example: 
use basic "for" loop can print four ? in a row or 3*3 brick 
Most similar cases in fancy games today use the same logic (good way to stimulate interest)

6. importance to understand limitation of computers, eg:
  32 bits/ 64 bits can only represnt limited numbers
  precision is limited (take 1/10 as an example, the result is 0.1000000014901161193847656250000)
  
7. on 19 January 2038, we will experience the same problem on 1st January 2020 (Year 2000 bug)
Because 32 bits only represent 4 billion seconds from 1st January 1970
